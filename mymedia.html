    My favorite TV show is The Office, and I love watching it when I can't find
    anything else to watch. I have watched all **9 seasons** of the show around
    15 times through, and I still love the show. One fun fact about the show is
    that the lots of the intro to the show is from a trip that John
    Krasinski(Jim) took through Scranton, PA.

    My favorite movie is John Wick, where he seeks revenge on the people who
    attacked him in his home, no matter the cost
